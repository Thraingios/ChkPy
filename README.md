    ChkPy! is a wrapper for 3 python development tools, pylint, pycodestyle & auopep8.

Pylint provides syntax-error reporting, pycodestyle provides styling reporting & auopep8 provides enforcement of both.

ChkPy! also has 3 options. these modes/options are explained below in detail.
```

      (Before and after mode)
