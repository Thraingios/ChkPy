```

2. Install with command:

```
# How to use ChkPy!
```

2. Make sure your current directory is correct

3. Type "chkpy (filename/directory) (-options)  
```
# ChkPy!'s 3 Options:
```
    - The default or " " which runs reporting tools before and after attempting to fix styling/syntax 
      (Before and after mode)
    
    - The "-r" option which only runs reporting tools against the given file/directory 
      (reporting mode)

    - The "-d" option which runs reporting tools AFTER attempting to fix styling/syntax 
      (devleoper mode)
```
# Example(s)
```
    - chkpy Filename  (-r or -d ) 

    - chkpy Directory  (-r or -d )
```
### ChkPy will allow you to run BOTH modes simultaneously. THIS IS NOT RECOMENDED. DO NOT DO THIS.
