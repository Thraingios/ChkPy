        This is where we take the arguments
        passed when making the object and
        turns them into usable commands.
        we then iterate through this command list using eval
        to actually run the command
        (note i know its techinally bad practice but the user wont be
        supplying any of the arguments for it and is just used internally)
        from there we take the output (if any) from each command and append it
        to command out which is then returned to the user
